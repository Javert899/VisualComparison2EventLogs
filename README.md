This project uses stochastic conformance checking techniques and performance spectrum to compare two event logs which can be an event log and the simulated process.
- The Earth Mover's Distance technique is used to measure the distance of two event logs and visualize the results in detail. 
- The code supports both 'CSV' and 'XES' event logs. 
- To simulate a process (comparing an event log and its simualted version), the web application [SIMPT](https://github.com/mbafrani/SIMPT-SimulatingProcessTrees) can be used. 
- To use the library, open the CompareTwoLog.py and in the main section insert the address of two event logs.
